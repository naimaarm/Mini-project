EEI3346 - WEB APPLICATIONS DEVELOPMENT-
Create a website that displays Tourist information about Sri Lanka. This must contain all the 
well-known tourist places. It can be named “Pearl of the Indian Ocean” and it should 
contain an appropriate theme. Users could be able to browse Province/District wise 
information as well; it would be appreciated if you add other details like general information 
of SL and contact details of the service providers, etc.
The page should contain at least 5 distinct web pages, should have a captivating look, and be 
interactive. Some suggestions for pages are Home, about us, separate pages for tourist 
information, queries, To-Do List and Contact Us.
Guidelines:
1. You are free to decide on suitable pages, images, and their components as long as the 
basic requirements of the website are met.
2. Create a To-Do list using VueJs where users can enter their preferences (i.e: they 
can enter the list of the places where they planned to visit.), once they complete it, the 
list should display separately by the side of the same page.
3. Usages of Templates are prohibited. Make sure to avoid irrelevant 
components/information.
4. You are advised to use CSS, JavaScript, and VueJs framework to improve the look 
and feel of the website.
5. Backend functionality is NOT expected to be implemented.
6. E-commerce integration is NOT expected.
7. Marks will be distributed for the correct usage of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and VueJs.
